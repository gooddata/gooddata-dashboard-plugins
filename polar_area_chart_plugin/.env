## They will never make their way into a production build of the plugin itself. Plugins developed in a generic

# Specify backend URL including protocol. The Analytical Backend used by the development harness will connect
# to this backend via proxy.
#
# If you do not provide backend URL, the harness will connect to public server used by GD.UI Examples Gallery
#
# Note: If you do provide backend URL, then you must also specify custom workspace and dashboard because the default
# workspace and the default dashboard are only available on the public server.
BACKEND_URL=https://demo.cloud.gooddata.com/

# Specify workspace that contains dashboard against which you want to develop and test the plugin.
#
# If you do not provide workspace, the harness will use default workspace used by GD.UI Examples Gallery
