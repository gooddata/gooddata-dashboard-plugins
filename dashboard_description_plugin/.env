## This .env file will be picked up by the Dashboard Plugin development harness; the values contained herein
## will be used only while developing the plugin.
##
## They will never make their way into a production build of the plugin itself. Plugins developed in a generic
## way can work out of the box on any backend, workspace or dashboard.
##
## Note: you should keep any secrets away from this file and ideally commit to VCS.

# Specify backend type (when using bear)
#
# both 'tiger' and 'bear' backends are supported, 'tiger'(panther) is the default
# Note that when linking a plugin with tiger backend using plugin scripts from package.json,
# remove temporarily '@gooddata/sdk-backend-bear' from peerDependencies,
# otherwise the script will consider the backend is bear, and fail subsequently.
# In order to use Bear backend, uncomment the line below
#BACKEND_TYPE=bear

# Specify backend URL including protocol. The Analytical Backend used by the development harness will connect
# to this backend via proxy.
# If you do not provide backend URL, the harness will connect to public server used by GD.UI Examples Gallery
#
# Note: If you do provide backend URL, then you must also specify custom workspace and dashboard because the default
# workspace and the default dashboard are only available on the public server.
BACKEND_URL=https://demo.cloud.gooddata.com/

# Specify workspace that contains dashboard against which you want to develop and test the plugin.
#
# If you do not provide workspace, the harness will use default workspace used by GD.UI Examples Gallery
WORKSPACE=d256a56db8db4173825564d1d4cbd2f9

# Specify dashboard against which you want to develop and test the plugin.
#
# If you do not provide dashboard, the harness will use a nice dashboard from GD.UI Examples Gallery
